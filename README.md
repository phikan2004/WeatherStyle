# WeatherStyle
A fun project I'm working on to help make my day a bit easier.

I am currently developing a personalized daily weather advisory system. As soon as the day begins, the system sends an SMS message with clothing recommendations based on real-time weather data, simplifying daily wardrobe choices and ensuring a smooth start to the day. The system leverages the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data retrieval and OpenAI's language model for recommendation generation, making it a convenient solution for weather-related decisions.
